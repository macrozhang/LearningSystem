## Project detailed

**Name:** Learning management system

**Brief information:** In a learning management system there are given teachers, tasks and submissions. A teacher may have many tasks, and a task can belong to one teacher. A task can have many submissions, but a submission can belong to only one task.

**Detailed task:**

- **Main page** The main page is a greeting page, no other functionality can be accessed without authentication.
- **Login** A teacher can log in with its username and password. (The users are already registered in the database. Please provide some username-password pairs on the page, to accomplish the login.)
- **Listing page** After authentication list the tasks belonging to the authenticated teacher.
- **Task details** Clicking on a task name on the listing page, the details of the task (name, description) can be read on a different page, and the submissions belonging to the task. In the list show the name of the submitter and the submission date.
- **Submission details** Clicking on a submission show on the task details page, the details of the submission is shown on a different page: name of the submitter, the submission date and solution as a text.
- **Evaluating a submission** On the submission details page the teacher can evaluate the submission by giving a point value to the submission. Saving this, the task details page appears, with the point number beside the submissions in the list.
